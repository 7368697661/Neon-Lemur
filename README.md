# Neon-Lemur

# ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT
This theme... thing is a collection of experiments to push Obsidian closer towards an "anti-design" concept piece.

Currently, there are lots of performance concerns (the transluceny chugs on my laptop) and the code is a complete mess.

Currently, the theme looks like:

However, changing the background is fairly simple

- Upload image to Imgur
- Right click image and open in new tab
- Get the url, here are two that i was experimenting with as reference:
    - `https://i.imgur.com/9AR09Ir.png`
    - `https://i.imgur.com/a6xfD7J.png`
- Paste that url here:

```
.horizontal-main-container, .horizontal-main-container {
 background: url("https://i.imgur.com/9AR09Ir.png"); /* <- paste here */
 background-size: cover;
 background-color: transparent;
}
```

Color accents and everything else are another story. If you feel brave, good luck and go for a dive! Otherwise, i will probably only update this slowly for now.

# Inspiration and credit:
Translucent structure came from a screenshot @anubis posted, i never would have been able to bring this idea back otherwise :)

Lots of code from Ultra Lobster

Several snippets from community members and themes (credit is in code for now, i'll rewrite this section in the future but please let me know if i forgot anything :))

Red background originally from dante

Blue from an image i thought i pinned but am still looking for ;-;
